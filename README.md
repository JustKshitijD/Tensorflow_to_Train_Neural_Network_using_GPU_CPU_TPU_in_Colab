Neural Network was trained using Tensorflow, using AdamOptimizer. Number of layers and number of neurons in each layer were varied, and RMSE error got was plotted. The same networks were run on CPU, GPU, TPU provided by Colab, and time taken was noted. 
Full report is in Report.pdf.

I am sharing the link of my Colab source code, and I am also sharing an NY1.ipynb file (though the code will have to be copy pasted to Colab, if it is to be run).

There are 2 files.upload() in the colab code. In the first link, upload 'new_new_york_taxi_set.csv', and in the 2nd link, upload 'validation.csv', when you run the cells corresponding to these commands. 

The cells after that can be run normally.
