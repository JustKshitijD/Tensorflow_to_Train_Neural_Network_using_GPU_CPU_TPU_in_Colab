I am sharing the link of my Colab source code, and I am also sharing an NY1.ipynb file (though the code will have to be copy pasted to Colab, if it is to be run).

There are 2 files.upload() in the colab code. In the first link, upload 'new_new_york_taxi_set.csv', and in the 2nd link, upload 'validation.csv', when you run the cells corresponding to these commands. 

The cells after that can be run normally.
